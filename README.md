36 hour co2-controller hackathon

This project is the result of a 36 hour hackathon, where the goal was to create a co2 controller for a greenhouse.
This hackathon was completed in a group of four students, and the workload was evenly distributed.

Hardware components of the system:
- LPC1549 LPCXpresso MCU
- 16x2 LCD display
- Rotary Encoder
- Relay to open the CO2 solenoid valve
- Vaisala GMP252 CO2 probe
- Vaisala HMP60 relative humidity and temperature sensor
- ESP-based WiFi-module
